<p>
  Hi again! Currently I'm doing this project to complete my first lab. We are learning HTML at Web Development course. <br>
  Honestly, I'm thinking of being backend developer after completing this course. Of course, there is enough time to think about the position. <br>
  Also I'm learning Android Studio in free time, but ofc finding free time to android is quite hard, but I try to do that. <br>
  If you don't know this symbol <>, so it is the google developer logo. <br>
  I usually end my post with some quite, so here is today quote below. But before look at my photo where I got grant to study at PPU <br>
